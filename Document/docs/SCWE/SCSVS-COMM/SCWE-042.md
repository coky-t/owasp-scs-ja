## 関連
- CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
  [CWE-829 Link](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)

## 説明
Insecure use of external calls refers to vulnerabilities that arise when calling external contracts without proper validation or safeguards. This can lead to:
- Unauthorized actions by malicious actors.
- Loss of funds or data.
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the called contract.

## 対策
- **Validate targets:** Ensure the target contract is trusted and secure.
- **Use secure libraries:** Leverage well-audited libraries for external calls.
- **Test thoroughly:** Conduct extensive testing to ensure external calls are secure.

## 事例
- **Insecure External Call**
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    contract InsecureExternalCall {
        function callExternal(address target, bytes memory data) public {
            (bool success, ) = target.call(data); // No validation
            require(success, "Call failed");
        }
    }
    ```

- **Secure External Call**
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    interface ITrustedContract {
        function executeAction(uint256 param) external;
    }

    contract SecureExternalCall {
        address public immutable trustedTarget;
        address public owner;

        constructor(address _trustedTarget) {
            trustedTarget = _trustedTarget;
            owner = msg.sender;
        }

        modifier onlyOwner() {
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized");
            _;
        }

        function callExternal(uint256 param) public onlyOwner {
            ITrustedContract(trustedTarget).executeAction(param);
        }
    }
    ```
Why is this secure?
- No arbitrary data input—Only predefined `function executeAction(uint256)` can be called.
- Access control added—Only the owner can execute external calls.
- Interface-based call—Avoids raw `.call()`, reducing attack vectors.
- Immutable trusted address—Prevents runtime modifications to the target contract.
