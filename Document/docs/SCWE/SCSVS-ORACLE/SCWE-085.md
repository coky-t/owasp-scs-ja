## 説明

This weakness occurs when smart contracts consume price oracle data (e.g., from Chainlink) without verifying whether the returned price falls within an expected or trusted range (e.g., `minPrice`/`maxPrice`). Oracles may return fallback floor or ceiling values when actual prices exceed internal limits or when the feed encounters data instability.

Failing to detect and reject such edge-case values can result in incorrect or exploitable logic paths in smart contracts. This weakness may allow attackers to:

- Trigger mispriced swaps or asset conversions.
- Exploit collateralization thresholds.
- Manipulate auction pricing or tiered reward structures.
- Influence governance systems based on price weightings.

These issues are especially dangerous during periods of high volatility or partial oracle outages, where fallback values may be automatically returned.

---

## 対策

To mitigate this risk:

- Always verify that the oracle-provided price lies within an expected range.
- Check whether the returned value is a fallback boundary by comparing it against known `minPrice`/`maxPrice` values.
- Monitor and log unusual oracle values for off-chain alerts and incident response.

## 事例

- Vulnerable contract 

```solidity
(int256 price,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(oracle).latestRoundData();

// Uses price directly without checking for boundary values
uint256 tokenAmount = uint256(price) * userInput;
```
- Fixed Contract 

```solidity
(int256 price,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(oracle).latestRoundData();

// Validate that the price is within trusted bounds
require(price > minPrice && price < maxPrice, "Price out of expected bounds");

uint256 tokenAmount = uint256(price) * userInput;
```
This ensures that the contract rejects unexpected oracle values that might be returned during errors or manipulation attempts.
